# Exercise 6: Lab â€“ Fetch Data (Page 69)

Make use of the fetch API to retrieve data from the JSON Placeholder API and display it. Set the limit default to 10. When the page loads up, it will use the default value. 
Similar to the previous templating labs, use bootstrap cards and grids to layout the returned post data from JSON Placeholder on the page.
