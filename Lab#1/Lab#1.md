# Exercise 1: Lab – Figma (Page 28)
 No right or wrong specifically, follow the design procedure:
·        Requirements
·        Sketch
·        Lo-Fi
·        Hi-Fi
Make the figma link public and viewable and just create a file that has a link to it in your labs repository.

Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your
content and posts from other users are visible. Don’t just jump into Figma, try to follow
the design procedure.
Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research and come up with
a personal design. For example, it could be a social media application dedicated to the
Warhammer Community, or the Ferrari Lovers.
