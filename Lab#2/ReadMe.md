# Exercise 2: Lab – Template (Page 36)
## Make sure you do all three parts!
1.  Ensure the addCard function can have content passed to the card dynamically.
2. Modify the code to call addCard repeatedly, so the cards are automatically generated based on data from an array. This ensures that you can make as many cards as needed to display all the data in the array. Use the provided code on the right hand side as the data. 
const data = [{name: ‘bob’, age: 23}, {name: ‘alice’, age: 39}]
3. Generate multiple templates and populate your web page dynamically, use the provided code on the slide of Van Gogh and his portfolio.
