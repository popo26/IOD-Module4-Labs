## Exercise 10: E-Commerce page (Page 95)

Try to do at least the first 3 points: fetch the Fake Store product data, use templating to display it via bootstrap cards, and include a drop-down to allow users to filter the products by category.
The remaining exercises are optional, so try them if youâ€™re ahead of time and/or wanting a challenge.
The first mini-project is given at the end of Module 4, so the extra time may be better spent working on your mini-project instead, OR you could choose to include even more features and extend this exercise into becoming your mini-project.

### Used this exercise plus more features as my first mini-project
